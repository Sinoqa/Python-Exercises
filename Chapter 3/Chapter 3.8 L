#  Write a program that prints out the sine and cosine of the angles ranging from 0 to 345◦
# in 15◦  increments. Each result should be rounded to 4 decimal places. Sample output is shown
# below:

import math
for i in range(0,360,15):
    cos = f"{round(math.sin(math.radians(i)),4)}"
    sin = f"{round(math.cos(math.radians(i)),4)}"
    print(f"{i} --- ",cos,sin)
