# write a program that generates 50 random numbers such that the first number is between 1
# and 2, the second is between 1 and 3, the third is between 1 and 4, . . . , and the last is between
# 1 and 51.

from random import randint
import random
a = 2
for i in range(0,50):
    x = randint(1,a+1)
    #this code just checks if the range is right
    # print(f"the range is 1 and {a}")
    print(x)
    a+=1
