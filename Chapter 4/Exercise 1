# Write a program that asks the user to enter a length in centimeters. If the user enters a negative
# length, the program should tell the user that the entry is invalid. Otherwise, the program
# should convert the length to inches and print out the result. There are 2.54 centimeters in an
# inch.


length = int(input("input length in centimeters > "))

if length <1:
    print("It is invalid please try again")

else:
    print(f"{length/2.54} in")
