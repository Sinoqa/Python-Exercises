# Write a multiplication game program for kids. The program should give the player ten randomly generated multiplication questions to do. After each, the program should tell them
# whether they got it right or wrong and what the correct answer is

from random import randint

#loops for the 10 questions
for i in range(1,11):
    rand_n1 = randint(1,9)
    rand_n2 = randint(1,9)
    c_answer = rand_n1 * rand_n2                        # this is the correct answer
    print(f"question {i} :{rand_n1} x {rand_n2} ")      #prints the equation
    u_answer = int(input("enter the answer here > "))   #user enters their answer


# This is the logic behind the code(Whether the answer is right/wrong)
    if u_answer == c_answer:
        print("Right.")
    else:
        print(f"Wrong. The answer is {c_answer}")
