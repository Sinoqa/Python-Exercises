# Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and prints out all the divisors of that
# number. [Hint: the % operator is used to tell if a number is divisible by something. See Section
# 3.2

user_n = int(input("enter desired number here > "))
print (f"{user_n} is divisible by these numbers : ", end=" ")
for i in range(1,user_n+1):
    if user_n % i == 0:
            print(i, end=' ')
