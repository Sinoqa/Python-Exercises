#  An integer is called squarefree if it is not divisible by any perfect squares other than 1. For
# instance, 42 is squarefree because its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 21, and 42, and none of those
# numbers (except 1) is a perfect square. On the other hand, 45 is not squarefree because it is
# divisible by 9, which is a perfect square. Write a program that asks the user for an integer and
# tells them if it is squarefree or not.
