# Write a program that asks the user to enter a word that contains the letter a. The program
# should then print the following two lines: On the first line should be the part of the string up
# to and including the the first a, and on the second line should be the rest of the string. Sample
# output is shown below:

def find_a(word):
    a_finder = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter.lower() =="a":
            a_finder+=1
            break

        else:
            a_finder+=1
    print(word[:a_finder])
    print(word[a_finder:])


find_a("megAtron")
