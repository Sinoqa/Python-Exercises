# Write a program that asks the user to enter two strings of the same length. The program
# should then check to see if the strings are of the same length. If they are not, the program
# should print an appropriate message and exit. If they are of the same length, the program
# should alternate the characters of the two strings. For example, if the user enters abcde and
# ABCDE the program should print out AaBbCcDdEe.
