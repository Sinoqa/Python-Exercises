# When I was a kid, we used to play this game called Mad Libs. The way it worked was a friend
# would ask me for some words and then insert those words into a story at specific places
# and read the story. The story would often turn out to be pretty funny with the words I had
# given since I had no idea what the story was about. The words were usually from a specific
# category, like a place, an animal, etc.
# For this problem you will write a Mad Libs program. First, you should make up a story and
# leave out some words of the story. Your program should ask the user to enter some words
# and tell them what types of words to enter. Then print the full story along with the inserted
# words. Here is a small example, but you should use your own (longer) example:

def madlibs():
    game = input("Enter a game >")
    feeling = input("Enter the feeling you get whgen you play this game >")
    place = input("A place where you usually play this game>")
    skill = input("how good are you in this game >")
    requirement = input("what skills do you need to play this game >")

    print(f"""I really love playing {game}, it keeps me away from reality and helps me become 
          {feeling}, I often play it in my free time in my {place}. This game requires serious {requirement},
        and I am {skill} at this game.""")
